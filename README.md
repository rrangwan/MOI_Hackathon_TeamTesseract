Description of Solution: To enable people who cannot see or read, but can hear to naviate the mobile app.

Reasoning: While desktop computers and apple products have tools available to help visually challenged users, when it comes to Android mobile apps, there is no such tool available. <br>
Each app needs to generate aids by itself. <br> I have creted a demonstration for how assistance can be provided for the blind, on the existing MOI android app. <br>
This feature is also useful for those who cannot read English, and for those who prefer a clutter free navigation experience.<br>
If given more time I would include a version in Arabic and provide the output "Criminal Report" in Braile Ready Format.<br>
