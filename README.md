Description of Solution: To enable people who cannot see or read, but can hear to naviate the mobile app.

Reasoning: While destop computers and apple products have tools available to help visually challenged users, when it comes to Android mobile apps, there is no such tool available. Each app needs to generate aids by itself. This is a brief demonstration, if given more time I would include a version in Arabic and provide the output report in Braile Ready Format.

How to build and run:
npm run build <br>
npm run dev

then goto: http://localhost:3000/
